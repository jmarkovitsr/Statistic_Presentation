# Introduction


- Homogeneity is the feature that characterizes the urban Chilean society. 
- Although there are an important percentage of indigenous people, they generally lived in rural areas
- 1996 A diaspora from the countryside by Indigenous people toward the cities since Chile achieved economic stability (Moulian, 2013)
- 2010 People from different countries have established in the region. 
- 23.8% are people of Peruvian nationality, 13% are Colombian, 12% Venezuelan, 11% Bolivian and 10% Haitian

#Background 
- Chile has a high level of inequality in education and segregation school system is one of the most relevant topics in the country (Nuñez & Espinoza, 2014; Nuñez & Miranda, 2011; OECD, 2010)
- Leopolodo Castedo (1999) : intercultural process/ Independence cultural homogenization 
- Not-legitimization of cultural diversity from the formal schooling system
- City segregation
- 1993: CONADI
- 1996: PEIB

# Research question and Hypothesis 


## Research question  
- Is there a correlation between the proposal of interculturality proposed by the Ministry of Education and the educational practices in high-schools?

## Hypothesis 

- Pedagogic practices in high-school have a negative effect in the developing of interculturality as competence within the classroom

# Methods

### Participants
- Ten university instructors from the state university Universidad de Playa Ancha.
- Six  Department of Linguistics
- Two  Department of History and Geography.
- Two  Department of Philosophy. 
- Age ranged from 32 and 50 years old. 

### Materials
- Items selected for the experiment  from a class activity performed by 37 8th grade girl-students from a high school in an urban center. Ages ranged from 13 to 14 years old.  
- Class activity

#DEPENDENT VARIABLES?
#INDEPENDENT VARIABLES?
#WHAT TEST SHOULD WE RUN?


---

# The Basics
## Independent variable(s)
- Items selected

## Dependent variable(s)
- Difference in FCT 1 and FCT 2 score

# Statistical Testing
##  T-TEST FOR DEPENDENT SAMPLES
- Within Subject Design
- 1 independent variable
- 1 dependent variable

# Steps 
## 1. Define Null and Alternative Hypotheses

##2. Calculate Degrees of Freedom

- df for Dependent Samples t-Test
- df =  N-1
- df = 347 -1 = 346

##3.Run T-test
- but first Run descriptives to get M, SD, kurtosis, and skewness

##3. Check t observed and t critical

- t observed ≥ t critical = significant
- t obsereved < t critical = not significant
- t critical = 1645
- t observed = -2.487
- t observed is significant

# Results 
To test the hypothesis that pedagogical practices in high-school have a negative effect in the developing of interculturality as a competence within the classroom, a T-test was performed to analyze FCT 1 and FCT 2 mean. The hypothesis was that the instructor s FCT 1 mean was lower than the instructor s FCT 2 mean.  Before conducting the analysis, the assumption of normal distributed differenced score was examined. The assumption was considered satisfied, as the skewness and kurtosis level was estimated at -.344 and -1.457, respectively for forced-choice task 1 and -.721 and -1.262 respectively for forced-choice task 2 which is less than the maximum allowable for a t-test. A dependent sample T-test reveal a significant difference in Forced-choice task 1 mean (M=2.18, SD= .827) and Forced-choice task 2 mean (M=2.35 SD= .858); t (346) = -1.2487, p < 0.05, indicating that the pedagogical practices within the classroom have a negative effect in developing interculturality as a competence in the classroom.
